# Off Grid Console — OSS Services Matrix

**What this is:** every open-source service we run on the on-prem fleet, what it's *for*, the
APIs/functionality it exposes, the purpose of that functionality, and — the important column —
**what the console actually consumes today vs. what's still available to wire up.**

Legend for integration depth:
- 🟢 **Deep / active** — the console calls it in-path on real requests (or reads its data back into a console view).
- 🟡 **Partial** — one direction only (write-only sink, or read-only), or built-but-not-default.
- ⚪ **Available, not active** — implemented/reachable but not selected in the current deployment.
- 🔴 **Not integrated** — running (or scaffolded) but the console doesn't use it yet.

Where they run: **S1 (127.0.0.1)** — OpenSearch, Qdrant, OPA, OpenBao, Marquez, Temporal, Postgres, Keycloak.
**S2 (192.168.1.60)** — Langfuse, Superset, FleetDM, Presidio, Unleash, Redis.

## Per-service detail

### Postgres + pgvector — state, audit, vector
**Purpose:** the console's system of record. Holds every module's data, the append-only audit log
(source of truth), and — via pgvector — a server-scale vector option for the Brain.
**Exposed:** SQL (Drizzle ORM), pgvector similarity search.
**Console consumes:** everything — fleet/control/data/agents/chat/projects/knowledge state, audit
events (which feed Analytics/FinOps/Regulatory), agent-run traces. **🟢 fully used.**

### Keycloak — identity / SSO
**Purpose:** who can log in. OIDC realm `offgrid`, restricted to `@example.com`.
**Exposed:** OIDC (authorize/token/userinfo), admin API, SCIM.
**Console consumes:** the sign-in flow (NextAuth → Keycloak). Roles come from the user record.
**Available, not wired:** SCIM group→role auto-provisioning (stub endpoint exists). **🟢.**

### OPA — policy-as-code
**Purpose:** centralized allow/deny decisions (RBAC/ABAC) evaluated as code.
**Exposed:** `POST /v1/data/<pkg>` (decisions), policy bundles, decision logs, metrics.
**Console consumes:** `POST /v1/data/offgrid/authz` with `{input}` on **every agent run**; falls back
to the first-party ABAC evaluator if OPA is unreachable.
**Not used:** bundle delivery/auto-update, decision-log streaming. **🟢 active.**

### Presidio — PII detection / redaction
**Purpose:** find (and mask) personal data in prompts/outputs — a guardrail.
**Exposed:** `POST /analyze` (entity detection), `POST /anonymize` (ML redaction), custom recognizers.
**Console consumes:** `POST /analyze` in-path on every request (pre-input + post-output), reports the
entity types found; falls back to a regex detector.
**Not used:** `/anonymize` (redaction is done with regex string-replace, not Presidio's ML),
custom recognizers, non-English languages. **🟢 detect / 🟡 redact.**

### Redis — response cache
**Purpose:** exact/semantic response cache in front of the gateway → lower latency & cost.
**Exposed:** GET/SET/TTL, INCR (rate limits), pub/sub, transactions.
**Console consumes:** get/set response cache with write-through to an in-process fallback.
**Not used:** INCR rate-limiting, pub/sub. **🟢 active.**

### Unleash — feature flags
**Purpose:** toggle capabilities without redeploying; gate features per environment.
**Exposed:** `/api/frontend/features`, strategies (gradual/percentage), segments, variants, metrics.
**Console consumes:** flag lookups (e.g. `agent-code-exec`, `online-evals`) with Postgres fallback.
**Not used:** strategies, segments, A/B variants. **🟢 active.**

### OpenSearch — SIEM
**Purpose:** durable, full-text-searchable audit/log store + dashboards.
**Exposed:** `_bulk` (ingest), `_search` (query + filters), aggregations, alerting, Dashboards UI.
**Console consumes:** ships the audit log via `_bulk`; **the gateway aggregator now indexes every
model call** into `offgrid-gateway`; and there's a **SIEM search read-back** ("Audit search" on the
Control page) that queries `_search`. Dashboards embeddable via the embed guard.
**Not used:** aggregations/faceting, watcher alerting. **🟢.**

### Langfuse — LLM tracing
**Purpose:** trace every model/agent step, score answer quality, track per-trace cost.
**Exposed:** OTLP ingest, ingestion API (traces+scores), `/api/public/traces` + `/observations`
(query), cost API.
**Console consumes:** pushes OTLP spans per agent step + LLM-as-judge scores; **reads traces back**
into an expandable list + **span waterfall** on Observability.
**Not used:** per-trace cost rollups into FinOps. **🟢.**

### Marquez — data lineage (OpenLineage)
**Purpose:** source → chunk → answer provenance; what data produced what output.
**Exposed:** `POST /api/v1/lineage` (emit), `/namespaces`, `/jobs`, `/datasets`, lineage graph query.
**Console consumes:** emits OpenLineage events on ingest/retrieve/agent-run; **reads the job→dataset
graph back** into the Lineage page (alongside the audit-reconstructed view).
**🟢.**

### OpenBao — secrets vault
**Purpose:** store connector/tool/API-key secrets encrypted, out of env files.
**Exposed:** KV v2 read/write/list, dynamic secrets, transit encryption, PKI, audit.
**Console consumes:** KV read/write/list via the secrets adapter, with a **Secrets Vault panel** on
Control; `getSecrets()` now has real call sites.
**Not used:** dynamic secrets, transit/PKI, lease rotation. **🟢 (KV).**

### Qdrant — vector store
**Purpose:** server-scale vector search for the Brain (alternative to embedded LanceDB).
**Exposed:** collections, upsert, search, scroll, snapshots, quantization.
**Console consumes:** full client (`ensureCollection`/upsert/search/scroll) + a **"Reindex Brain →
Qdrant"** admin action so it's not empty. **Not the default** — activate with
`OFFGRID_ADAPTER_RETRIEVAL=qdrant` (default is LanceDB).
**Not used:** batch ops, quantization, sharding. **⚪ available, not active.**

### Superset — BI / dashboards
**Purpose:** dashboards, SQL Lab, pivot/exploration over console data.
**Exposed:** dashboards, `/api/v1/chart|dataset|sqllab`, guest-token embedded SDK.
**Console consumes:** mints a **guest token** and embeds a Superset dashboard on Analytics (behind
the embed guard). **Requires a one-time `superset init`** (admin + metadata) to show real data.
**Not used:** SQL Lab, dataset provisioning. **🟡.**

### FleetDM — osquery device fleet
**Purpose:** osquery-based cross-platform device inventory, policies, live queries.
**Exposed:** hosts, teams/policies, live queries, software/vuln inventory, MDM control commands.
**Console consumes:** host list, live osquery, software + CVE inventory, and policy CRUD on the
Fleet page via REST + bearer token, with first-party fallback. **Requires a one-time
`fleetctl setup`.**
**Coming soon:** MDM device CONTROL (lock / wipe / config-profile push / settings enforcement /
APNs enrollment) - rendered in a disabled "coming soon" state today, not fired. Advanced MDM
control is Fleet Premium, separately licensed. **🟡.**

### Temporal — durable workflows
**Purpose:** durable, replayable multi-step agent execution (survives crashes).
**Exposed:** workflow/activity execution, retries, replay, `:7233` gRPC + `:8081` UI.
**Console consumes:** an **`AgentRuntimePort` adapter scaffold** exists (`syncRuntime` default;
`temporalRuntime` submits via HTTP bridge if configured). Agent runs are currently **synchronous /
Postgres-backed** — Temporal is not authoritative yet. **🔴 scaffold only.**

## Full container inventory (why OrbStack shows ~25+)

The 14 rows above are *logical* services. Several spin up multiple containers (their own DB, worker,
cache, UI), which is why OrbStack shows far more. Here's every container the compose defines:

| Logical service | Containers it runs | On fleet? |
|---|---|---|
| Postgres | `postgres` | ✅ S1 |
| Keycloak | `keycloak` | ✅ S1 |
| OPA | `opa` | ✅ S1 |
| OpenBao | `openbao` | ✅ S1 |
| Qdrant | `qdrant` | ✅ S1 |
| OpenSearch | `opensearch`, `opensearch-dashboards` | ✅ S1 (2) |
| Marquez | `marquez`, `marquez-db`, `marquez-web` | ✅ S1 (3) |
| Temporal | `temporal`, `temporal-db`, `temporal-ui` | ✅ S1 (3) |
| Langfuse | `langfuse`, `langfuse-worker`, `langfuse-db`, `langfuse-clickhouse`, `langfuse-minio`, `langfuse-redis` | ✅ S2 (6) |
| Superset | `superset` | ✅ S2 |
| FleetDM | `fleet`, `fleet-mysql`, `fleet-redis` | ✅ S2 (3) |
| Presidio | `presidio-analyzer`, `presidio-anonymizer` | ✅ S2 (2) |
| Unleash | `unleash`, `unleash-db` | ✅ S2 (2) |
| Redis (cache) | `redis` | ✅ S2 |
| Caddy edge | `caddy` (run **native**, not a container) | ✅ S1 |

That's **~29 containers** across the two service nodes → the "25-ish" you saw in OrbStack.

## Defined in compose but NOT deployed on the fleet (opt-in profiles)

These are in `deploy/docker-compose.yml` but intentionally off (not needed for the current console
feature set, or superseded). Enable by adding their profile and a service node:

| Service | Purpose | Why off / how to enable | Console use |
|---|---|---|---|
| **SeaweedFS** | S3-compatible object store for docs/artifacts | Artifacts + KB use Postgres/MinIO today; enable `--profile data` if you need blob storage | ⚪ none |
| **VictoriaMetrics** | Metrics time-series store | Metrics come from the native `:9100` dashboard; enable `--profile observability` for real TSDB | ⚪ none |
| **VictoriaLogs** | Log store (full-text) | OpenSearch covers log search; redundant for now | ⚪ none |
| **OTel Collector** | OTLP fan-out (metrics/logs/traces) | Console pushes traces straight to Langfuse's OTLP endpoint; collector unneeded | ⚪ none |
| **Jaeger** | Distributed-trace UI | Langfuse is the trace UI; Jaeger is the generic alternative | ⚪ none |
| **Evidently** | Drift-detection sidecar | Console uses native PSI drift; enable `--profile qa` to swap | ⚪ built-in default used |
| **Ragas** | RAG-eval sidecar | Console uses golden-set evals; enable `--profile qa` to swap | ⚪ built-in default used |

So: **14 logical services (~29 containers) running**, **7 more defined-but-off**. Total surface in
the compose ≈ 36 service definitions.

## The honest bottom line
- **Governance + observability + knowledge are genuinely wired both ways** now: OPA, Presidio,
  Redis, Unleash run in-path; OpenSearch/Langfuse/Marquez both write *and* read back into console
  views; OpenBao is a real secrets store.
- **Qdrant** is ready but the deployment defaults to embedded LanceDB — flip one env var to use it.
- **Superset / FleetDM** need their one-time init to show live data; they're read/embed-only.
- **Temporal** is the one still-open integration — scaffolded, not consuming.

_This matrix reflects state after the integration-deepening pass (Phase 8) + parity Waves 0–2.
